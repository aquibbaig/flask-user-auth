Generic single-database configuration.

Some useful commands to run migrations:

Migration commit files are stored in alembic/versions folder.

To create a db migration file
# alembic revision — autogenerate -m “First commit”

Using the above command alembic generate our first migration commit file in versions folder.
file names are usually stored as revision_id_<commit_message>.py

Once this file generates we are ready for database migration.
# alembic upgrade head

To upgrade to specific migration
# alembic upgrade <revision_id_>

To downgrade to specific migration
# alembic downgrade <revision_id_>
